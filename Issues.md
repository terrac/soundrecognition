One of the issues I currently have is that my system for guessing produces two equally likely words according to it which I think I can improve the rate greatly if I can have it pick the more likely of the two equal ones.

Also the pattern recognition needs some variables to be tweaked and for it to be properly moved into the run stuff for build possible patterns.

In addition to that the testing frameworks need to deal with multiple lengths.  The current uses seem to go long and I want to see if a combination of long and short will improve accuracy.
